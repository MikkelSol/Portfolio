Check out some of my projects below: 

# Senior Capstone Project

As part of the CMPT-390 class (Senior Capstone) at Westminster, I had a project to create a desktop application that had an intuitive and easy way to record and track equipment performance. Alpine skiing is a sport where equipment and attention to detail are extremely important, and by having a useful equipment application, users will be able to limit their time spent tracking the performance of their equipment and make it more convenient for athletes, coaches, and ski servicemen to find the best possible equipment combination for each individual. The application is aimed at people that would have any interest in knowing which ski equipment is faster, given certain variables. These variables are:

•	Surface conditions 
•	Slope profile 
•	Discipline 
•	Equipment used
•	Total time used 

With the desktop application user are able to change, add, or remove information about the user profile as they want For instance, if a user has a test between two pairs of skis on Friday, the user will fill out all the different variables related to the test. The next day the user skied a different slope that was significantly steeper, and the user would add a different slope profile to the users equipment profile. The equipment profile will now have additional information about the equipment and make it easier to see how the equipment differs from each other. Ultimately, a user will be able to look back at equipment tests and easily figure out what equipment combination is the best, given the different variables added. 

Overall, I was able to create a desktop application using primarily Java, Swing, and MySQL. The application can easily retrieve, store, and delete data from the database, it can also analyze and sort data so that the end user is able to get an idea of what ski pair is the fastest, given certain variables. The project ended up running super smoothly with limited bugs, and a new user should be able to navigate through the application, with some prior knowledge of testing ski equipment.

PS: I included this project as it is my most interesting and advanced project I have done. It also covered the learning goals of software development and project management, and helped me develop critical thinking and creativity.


# Leonardo Project

As part of the CMPT-375 class (Web Applications) at Westminster, I had a project with the end goal of helping real-life clients create a web application suited for their needs. The client, The Leonardo Museum in Utah, asked our group to make it easier for members to get exclusive content, calender updates, membership cards and more. As a group of 4 coders and 3 designers we created a web application from scratch, implementing both the back-end and the front-end of the application using Django as a framework. The project helped me learn what goes into the process of developing software, including the technical computer skills, the communications skills, and the project managments skills needed to complete tasks efficent and effective. For the project I mainly focused on the fron-end part of the application, using CSS and HTML coding languages. However, connecting the back-end and the front-end requires the knowledge of what is going on in the back-end as well. 

Overall this project helped me learn a lot of the whole process between back-end and front-end, essentically expanding my knowledge and helping the team figure out the best solution to any problems that came up during the coding process.

PS: I included this project as it is my biggest group project I have done. Working with design majors was very valuable and help me get better at project management, collaboration and communication. 

# Software Project

As part of the CMPT-322 class (Software Engineering) at Westminster, I had a project creating a simple math game targeted at 1st and 2nd graders. For the game my group of three came up with a simple 2D running game. The goal of the game was for the character to run from an object that wanted to catch them. To run from the object, the user would have to answer simple math games and the progress dependended on the user answering correctly. For the project we also wanted to have a way for teachers to access their students progress, add and remove students, and for the students themselves to have a menu with different options to choose from. My contribution to the project was creating the login systems for students and teachers, the database to store scores, and connect everything to the front-end of the project. 

Overall, the project helped me learn how to use C#, PHP, and SQL. In addition, the project also thaught me the usefullness of test plans and keep updating the projects status to figure out the speed we progressed and what needed to be prioritized.

PS: I included this project as it is a big project where moving image and figures was a big part of the project. This project also helped me understand concepts and processes for achieving organizational goals with information technology better, and helped me improve my communication skills. 

# UNO Project

As part of the CMPT-201 class (Intro to Computer Science) at Westminster, I had a project to create a UNO player in Java and optimize the player's score based on the various UNO rules. The goal of the project was to implement a program that could play the game of UNO by following the standard rules and making optimal decisions to maximize the player's score.

To complete the project, I had to first understand the rules of UNO and the different strategies that could be employed to win the game. I then had to design and implement the program in Java, ensuring that it could accurately play the game and make the best possible decisions. During the project, I also learned the importance of testing and debugging, as well as the need for careful documentation and version control. By keeping track of my progress and regularly updating my code, I was able to identify and fix issues quickly and ensure that my program was functioning correctly.

Overall, the project helped me develop my programming skills in Java and taught me valuable lessons in computer science and software development. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that provided me with a solid foundation for future projects in computer science.

PS: I included this project as it was very valuable for my learning. Also, being my first solo project in computer science it was super interesting and fun. This project also expanded my creativity and critical thinking skills.

# Liquor Cabinet Project

As part of the CMPT-307 class (Databases) at Westminster, I had a project to create a database where a user could keep track of what kind of alcohol they had in their house, to make it easier for people to find out what sorts of drinks they had the ingredients for. My app use the database to:

•	Add liquor
•	See all liquor and specific ones 
•	What kind of tools you have
•	Description of drinks you can make with the liquor
•	Remove bottles that are empty

Overall, the project was very valuable for me to learn more about creating database using multiple tables. Learning how to properly connect tables and create a plan of attack was super valuable for me and create a whole other knowledge of working with databases.

PS: I included this project as I found it super valuable for my development as a coder and help me get a better understanding of what databases are used for and the endless possibilities they give the users. This project help me develop as a coder, critical thinker, and expanded my creativity.
