Leaonardo Project:

As part of the CMPT-375 class (Web Applications) at Westminster, I had a project with the end goal of helping real-life clients create a web application suited for their needs. 
The client, The Leonardo Museum in Utah, asked our group to make it easier for members to get exclusive content, calender updates, membership cards and more.
As a group of 4 coders and 3 designers we created a web application from scratch, implementing both the back-end and the front-end of the application using Django as a framework. 
The project helped me learn what goes into the process of developing software, including the technical computer skills, the communications skills, and the project managments skills needed 
to complete tasks efficent and effective. For the project I mainly focused on the fron-end part of the application, using CSS and HTML coding languages. However, connecting the back-end
and the front-end requires the knowledge of what is going on in the back-end as well. This helped me learn a lot of the whole process between back-end and front-end, essentically expanding my knowledge
and helping the team figure out the best solution to any problems that came up during the coding process.
