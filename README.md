# Welcome to my, Mikkel Solbakken, portfolio page!

Here are some of my projects: 


# Leonardo Project

As part of the CMPT-375 class (Web Applications) at Westminster, I had a project with the end goal of helping real-life clients create a web application suited for their needs. The client, The Leonardo Museum in Utah, asked our group to make it easier for members to get exclusive content, calender updates, membership cards and more.As a group of 4 coders and 3 designers we created a web application from scratch, implementing both the back-end and the front-end of the application using Django as a framework. The project helped me learn what goes into the process of developing software, including the technical computer skills, the communications skills, and the project managments skills needed to complete tasks efficent and effective. For the project I mainly focused on the fron-end part of the application, using CSS and HTML coding languages. However, connecting the back-end and the front-end requires the knowledge of what is going on in the back-end as well. This helped me learn a lot of the whole process between back-end and front-end, essentically expanding my knowledge and helping the team figure out the best solution to any problems that came up during the coding process.

# Software Project

As part of the CMPT-322 class (Software Engineering) at Westminster, I had a project creating a simple math game targeted at 1st and 2nd graders. For the game my group of three came up with a simple 2D running game. The goal of the game was for the character to run from an object that wanted to catch them. To run from the object, the user would have to answer simple math games and the progress dependent on the user answered right or wrong. For the project we also wanted to have way for teachers to access their students progress, add and remove students, and for the students themselves to have a menu with different options. My contribution to the project was creating the login systems for students and teachers, the database to store scores and connect everything to the front-end of the project. As a result, the project helped me learn how to use C#, PHP, and SQL. In addition, the project also thaught me the usefullness of test plans and keep updating the projects status to figure out the speed we progressed and what needed to be prioritized.
